This project is a data wrangling and auditing project using python code to audit, fix, and convert an XML file to CSV files. Additionally, after this conversion, the CSV files were imported to a single database so that SQL queries could be used to further analyze the data. The region analyzed is the Lake Tahoe area, and the data was taken from openstreetmap.org. 

Map Link to Lake Tahoe Data
http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=10/39.0981/-119.9220

<bounds minlat="38.7819" minlon="-120.337" maxlat="39.4426" maxlon="-119.693"/>

This  region was chosen due to Lake Tahoe being one of my favorite locations in the world.
Additionally, I felt that it would be interesting to choose a location that is not
in a very populated urban area, to just see if there was an effect on how open
map data would look for a more rural area compared to an urban Area.
