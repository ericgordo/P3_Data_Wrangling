Map Link to Lake Tahoe Data
http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=10/39.0981/-119.9220

<bounds minlat="38.7819" minlon="-120.337" maxlat="39.4426" maxlon="-119.693"/>

This  region was chosen due to Lake Tahoe being one of my favorite locations in the world.
Additionally, I felt that it would be interesting to choose a location that is not
in a very populated urban area, to just see if there was an effect on how open
map data would look for a more rural area compared to an urban Area.
