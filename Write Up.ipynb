Ways on the other hand, are map objects that require boundaries like parks, boarders, or roadways. Both objects, Nodes and Ways can have one or more 'Tags' which are data objects that give ways and nodes their attributes.

    "#### Issues with Data\n",
    "While auding this data in more detail with python, there were more problems that were found even before importing the data into a SQL database. "

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. First, while auditing the tags, many tags had the key value of \"addr:street\" and these tags were thus audited to see what values useres inputted for street names. The values of these tags had some inconsistentcies due to what must be indvidiauls entering the street labels differently. For example a couple of highways were mislabeled like \"Hwy 80 PM 27.4,\" where the PM 27.4 does not make sense in context of a highway label. Additionally different tags used different abbrivations for the same endings. \"River Ranch Road\" and \"River Ranch Rd\" were entered in different tags, where they obviously refer to the same road. Thus these street values would be cleaned before importing into a SQL database. \n",
    "2. Athoer issue was found when auditing the tags with the key 'phone' label. These tags were attributes that refered to phone numbers for either businesses or stores, however formats for inputed phone numbers were highly inconssistent. Here are a few examples of the phone numbers found in this map data for four different entries:\n",
    "        \"+1 530-541-5160,\" \"530-541-5227,\" \"1 775-315-9574,\" and \"1-866-795-2709.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "      Thus all data inputted as \"NV\" and \"CA\" would be converted to \"Nevada\" and \"California\" respectivelClearly these phone numbers all have different formats, specifically with regards to how useres inputed the start of the phone numbers and the country \"+1\" code. This will therefore also be cleaned before being entered into our database, to create a slightly more uniform set of data.\n",
    "3. The key \"addr:state\" was used with tags to locate which state items in this map were found. The Lake Tahoe area is interesting because the lake is right on the border of the California and Nevada state line. Therefore there were tags for items in both California and Nevada. Therefore while audding the user inputed tags for state values, the following four ways of identifiyg state were found:\n",
    "              set(['CA', 'Nevada', 'California', 'NV'])\n",
    "\n",
    "   Before going any further then, it was clear that all data inputted as \"NV\" and \"CA\" would be converted to \"Nevada\" and \"California\" respectively before inputting as an SQL File. But it was good to see that not other states were found in this data. \n",
    "4. Finally, the major problem with this data seemed to quite simply be that a large lack of data for the area seems to be missing. While auditing for phone numbers, only 83 unique phone numbers were printed having the tag key of \"Phone.\" This seems very low for the area this data comes from, especially considering that South Lake Tahoe alone has a population of roughly 21,000 people, and this city only reprsents a small corner of the map shown above. Further investigation will be done once the data is in SQL searchable form, but for now it is worth noting that the data seemed very incomplete for the map area."

    "### Cross-Field Validation\n",
    "One last validation that was conducted before fixing some of the data issues, was a cross-field validation between city names and states. That is, because Lake Tahoe is encompassed in both California and Nevada, it is important to check to make sure each element that was tagged with a \"addr:city\" key and a \"addr:state\" key, was valid with the correct cities in each state.

    "The Data above shows some final stats about our Lake Tahoe Data, including the number of Nodes and Ways in our database, (which match our numbers from the start of this investigation) and the top contributors to the open map data.

    "The Lake Tahoe area data we analyized, which is characterised as being very full of nature and a small human population, seemed unique in several ways. It seems very interesting that the most frequent node as a key called \"power\", with also Highways and roads being the only other items tagged very commonly. \n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion for future analysis of this area is for an attempt to audit for completeness. While this is a highly subjective feeling, there seems to be a lot of data missing, even in the most raw form. Again noting that only 83 unique phone numbers were found, which makes me wonder how many additional Nodes could be incoorporated in this region of the open soruced map. Also while investigating some of the names of nodes, only three names were '7-Eleven', but I know for a fact that there are that many 7-Elevens just in North Lake Tahoe, meaning there are other 7-Elevens missing from this map data. If there was some sort of publically availible business database, or phone directory database, it would be very interesting to evaluate and analyze the completeness of this open sourced map for the Lake Tahoe Area with other databases that already exist. Also it would be insightful to compare a rural area's percent completeness with that of a different map in an urban setting. The distinction between a rural area and an urban area could possibly be insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious difficulties of auditing for completeness in any map, especially an opened sourced map, is setting the standard of what would be considered \"missing.\" A lot of the Lake Tahoe Area map seemed to also revolve around natural elements like bays and peaks , so it may be hard to find a database or source to compare these natural elements of the goegraphy, especially in data form, in order to audit for completeness. Maybe a phonebook directory or registered business databases could handle the for completeness business, but again, having reliable and the correct sources of data to compare this map data to maybe the overall most difficult aspect of auditing for completeness. Overall the Data for this area was pretty well entered with few errors or non-sensicle data entries, but further investigation on its completeness would in my opnion be the most beneficial future analysis.
